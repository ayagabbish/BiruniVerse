>  This repository documents the technical design, engineering processes, and development stages of our autonomous vehicle prototype. Built by three passionate engineering students, this robot is our gateway to the universe. United by creativity and curiosity, and supported by Birzeit University, we proudly present our journey in the WRO Future Engineers Challenge 2025.
## Content

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.

## Competition Overview

The World Robot Olympiad (WRO) challenges students to design and build autonomous robots.  
In the **Future Engineers** category, teams develop a self-driving car capable of navigating a randomized track using onboard sensors and control logic.  

The robot must be compact (**30 × 20 × 30 cm**) and operate fully without remote control.  
The goal is to replicate real-world autonomous driving, where the robot detects its environment, makes decisions, and completes laps reliably.  

Success is measured by both the robot’s performance on the track and the quality of the **engineering documentation** shared on GitHub, reflecting the full journey from design to competition-ready system.  

We chose to document our journey in the form of a story — step by step, from forming our team to building our final robot.  
Because in every line of code, every printed part, and every late-night fix, there is a story worth telling: a story of ideas turning into motion, and motion turning into achievement.  

##  Who Are We?

**spring 2025 – We came together.**  
Three students from different engineering backgrounds united with one goal: build a robot that goes beyond expectations.

-  **Alma Alkhader** – _Computer Engineer_  


-  **Aya Ghabish** – _Mechanical Engineer_  


- **Sara Afifi** – _Mechatronics Engineer_  


Together, we are **biruniVerse** — inspired by Birzeit and destined for the universe.

## Why BiruniVerse?

Our name **BiruniVerse** is built on two roots:  

- **Biruni** → A tribute to *Al-Biruni*, the great Muslim scholar and polymath, known for his groundbreaking contributions to science, astronomy, mathematics, and engineering. His curiosity and drive for discovery inspire us to push the limits of knowledge.  
- **Birzeituni (birUni)** → A proud reference to *Birzeit University*, our home, where this project was born. It connects our identity as students to a tradition of learning and innovation.  

The second part of our name, **Universe**, reflects our belief that through projects like these we are not only building robots — we are building the skills, imagination, and courage to reach for the universe itself.  

**BiruniVerse = Biruni + Birzeituni + Universe**  
A name that ties together heritage, identity, and aspiration.  

##  Robot Aims and Objectives

- Detect obstacles using sensors and camera.  
- Avoid obstacles from the correct side.  
- Drive on its own without help.  
- Fix itself if it crashes or gets stuck.  
- Count laps and stop after finishing.  
- Stay inside size and hardware limits.
